# Discord-Webcam-Macro
Program that runs in the background and allows for a macro to toggle webcam on Discord.

I made this because there are times that I want to turn off the camera on Discord with
the simple click of a button but for some reason they don't give that feature within the app itself.

When you click your macro the program will find the Discord process then calculate the position of the webcam button
based off of the position & dimensions of the Discord window.

# How To Change Macro
On first launch you will be brought to the settings window which will save on next startup.

# Add To Startup
If you'd like to add this application to startup,
you can compile it then create a shortcut and move that to 
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp
